### Hi everyone ðŸ¤˜ Ander Gutierrez here!
Curiosity: what a word; a magnificient way to describe the way I am. Curious by nature, I like to push myself beyond my current knowledge. Challenges may be fierce, but with the drive knowledge-hunger gives, a challenge may eventually be a new unexplored road. It shouldn't be easy, but at leat, is funny. 

That Instagram kind of motivational speech describes a part of me. I like to learn. I like to learn things that have a reason. Resulting in the overall, long-term code improvement. I try my best (sometimes whitout much success, I might say ðŸ˜…) to understand the most complex architectures so that I can add something to make it, long-term, simpler but robuster.

Backend is my personal preference, however I can add some value to front end coding. I would also add as a valuable note, that I'm not a really good styler ðŸ˜¬.
