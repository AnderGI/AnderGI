# Hi everyone ðŸ¤˜ Ander Gutierrez here!

> Curious by nature, I like to push myself beyond my current knowledge. Challenges may be fierce, but with the drive knowledge-hunger gives, a challenge may eventually be a new unexplored road. It shouldn't be easy, but at leat, is funny. [^1]
[^1]: Random Instagram motivational account. 

ðŸ‘‰ I like to learn and do thing with a reason. I need to know why something, even if its more intricating, should be taken as the right approach for something. 

ðŸ‘‰ I am self aware of the importance of having knowledge and sharing that with the rest. When someone is able to explain something complex with easy its a sign of mastery.

ðŸ‘‰ I can help creating software for back-end and/or front-end layers (hello js world).
