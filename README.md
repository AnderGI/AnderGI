# Hi everyone 🤘 Ander Gutierrez here!

> Curious by nature, I like to push myself beyond my current knowledge. Challenges may be fierce, but with the drive knowledge-hunger gives, a challenge may eventually be a new unexplored road. It shouldn't be easy, but at leat, is funny. [^1]
[^1]: Random Instagram motivational account. 

Some self traits 🙌 (not the CV must have ones):
- I like to learn and do thing with a reason. I need to know why something, even if its more intricating, should be taken as the right approach for something. 
- I am self aware of the importance of having knowledge and sharing that with the rest. When someone is able to explain something complex with easy its a sign of mastery.
- I can help creating software for back-end and/or front-end layers (hello js world).
- Long-term wizard 🧙‍♂.
- Rational thinking :godmode: .
- Not the greatest styler 😅 .
